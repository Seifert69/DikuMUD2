notes "This is part one of my second zone for Valhalla-USA. Planned as basically an Ogre city-state, with fungus mine, ogre town, slave pit, small over ground marsh area. Designed for levels 25-40. Mainly underground though. It's planned as a pretty large zone, basically the town, the mines, the pit, and the marsh area are separate. If you have any questions/queries/advice/bug-reports, please mail them to clarej@alf2.tcd.ie. Thanks :)"

help "So you want some help do you? Ok, this is Moochan Tandor - the land of the Ogres. It has been designed for those of levels 25-40, and anyone below that should be very careful here. If you need more help, look for Eirinn and he'll do his best to assist."

 placed all the way through the tunnel. They seem to be very old, and some bear the \
 marks of frequent and prolonged use." \
    extra {"luminous green fungus", "green fungus", "fungus"} \
"The fungus is like a mat here, fluffed like cotton wool in places. It seems to glow \
 in a luminous green, and glistens in the darkness. The smell seems to come from \
 the fruiting bodies on the fungus, probably the spores. The fungus seems to be \
 warm to the touch." \
    extra {"rock"} \
"The rock seems to have been chiselled out by great tools a long, long time ago. \
 It seems to be some sort of pale granite." \
    extra {"beads of moisture", "beads", "moisture"} \

 they are just a by-product of the fungus's activity." \

"The walls have been hewn out of the rock itself. They are quite uneven in places, but \
 very solid. They are almost devoid of fungus, the granite provides its own decoration \ 
 as pieces of mica and feldspar glint in the light as you pass." \
    extra {"ground", "floor", "pavement"} \
"The ground has been hewn out of the rock itself. It is more regular in shape than \ 
 the walls, either through design, or just continual use. It is covered with a light \
 dusting of what appears to be sand, though it could just be dust." \
    extra {"ceiling", "roof"} \
"The roof of this area is quite high, probably to allow the ogres to pass unencumbered. \
 It is hewn out of the granite which is the makes up most of the rock around here." \
    extra {"glowlights", "glowlight", "glow lights", "glow light", "lights", "light"} \
"These strange fittings look like torches, but instead of having a flame, their light \
 comes from the ball of fungus impaled on the end of a stone spike which has been \
 hammered into the wall. The light is a luminous green colour and it casts an eerie \
 glow on the place." \
    extra {"trash", "rubbish", "waste", "remnants", "remnant"} \
"The rubbish is made up of old bones, dead fungus, ogre excrement, even rocks and \
 pebbles. It all seems to be material which the ogres no longer value or want. The \ 
 idea of disposing of the rubbish properly probably hasn't occurred to them, and \
 you seriously doubt if it ever will..." \

#define PIT_EXTRAS \

"The walls are cut out of the sandstone rock which predominates the rock \
 type in this part of Moochan Tandor. They are around 3 metres high, and \
 then there is a huge space between their top and the cavern ceiling far \
 above. The walls are a faded red yellow colour, and there is a lot of \
 dust on the ground. Torches are mounted along the walls." \

"The ground is flat and unpaved. It is like the walls in colour, but there \
 is a light covering of dust on it." \
    extra {"ceiling", "roof"} \
"Far above you is the cavern ceiling, barely visible as the light only \
 barely penetrates the darkness as far as the ceiling It is domed, and \
 you wonder whether this is a natural cavern because you can't imagine \
 something so large could be hollowed out by hand." \
    extra {"torches", "torch"} \
"The torches burn with animal fat. They cast an orange glow on the \
 sandstone walls and floor, flickering in a draft which is barely \
 noticeable. The glow makes the yellow walls look like the sun is \
 shining on them." \
    extra {"gate"} \
"The gate is made from iron bars. You can see straight through it down \
 the main corridor of the slave pit. The gate is about 3 metres tall, and \
 is on a single hinge. It is not lockable and seems to serve only to mark \
 the entrance to the pit." \
    extra {"bars"} \
"These bars are made from iron. They are crude in design, but they serve \
 their purpose adequately. They are lockable, and there is large metal \
 lock on the right hand side. These would be almost impossible to force \
 open." \

"It's shit, what more can I say?!" \

"The dust is sandy coloured, probably from the sandstone walls." \

 they're absolutely covered in Fungus. They are curved up to the domed \
 ceiling of the cavern." \

"The ceiling of the cavern is dome shaped, and the fungus seems to ascend the walls \
 almost to the top of this dome. There is a bare patch right at the top, where the \
 bare granite reflects the eerie green light of the fungus back down into the cavern." \

"The ground is covered in a thick spongy blanket of fungus. It carpets the entire \
 cavern and even extends up the walls towards the ceiling. As you walk, you step \
 on the fungus and it gives you a strange feeling as it squelches and spurts green \
 ooze onto your feet." \
    extra {"fungus crop", "fungus", "carpet of fungus", "carpet"} \
"The fungus is a disgusting green colour. It grows in a carpet over the floor of the \
 cavern like a sickly green field. It emits an eerie luminous green light and this light \
 almost dazzles you because there is so much of it. The entire cavern seems to glow \
 and slowly throb with this spooky illumination. As you step on the fungus, it \
 releases a green fluid all over your feet." \
